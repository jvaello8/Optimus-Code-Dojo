### Fizz-Buzz Kata

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string. But for multiples of three it returns "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five it returns "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five returns "FizzBuzz".

#### Sample outputs

### Leap year

Write a function that returns true or false depending on
whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4,
but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is
also divisible by 400.

For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996
is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical
common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
